# 🚀 Deployment Instructions

## 📦 Repository Status
✅ **Git repository initialized and committed**
✅ **All files staged and ready**
✅ **Production-ready codebase**

## 🌐 GitHub Setup

### **1. Create GitHub Repository**
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
2. Click "New Repository"
3. Name: `scholarship-hunter` (or your preferred name)
4. Description: `AI-Powered Scholarship Discovery Platform with Uganda Focus`
5. Make it **Public** for Streamlit Cloud free tier
6. **Don't** initialize with README (we already have one)

### **2. Push to GitHub**
```bash
cd /workspaces/newfolder-trials/search_agent

# Add GitHub remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/scholarship-hunter.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 🚀 Streamlit Cloud Deployment

### **1. Deploy Application**
1. Visit [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
2. Click "New app"
3. Select your GitHub repository: `YOUR_USERNAME/scholarship-hunter`
4. Set main file path: `ui/app.py`
5. Click "Deploy!"

### **2. Optional: Add API Key (AFTER deployment)**
⚠️ **Important:** The app works perfectly WITHOUT an API key! This is only for enhanced AI features.

After your app is deployed on Streamlit Cloud:
1. Go to your app dashboard on Streamlit Cloud
2. Click "Settings" → "Secrets"
3. Add this content:
```toml
[gemini]
api_key = "your_gemini_api_key_here"
```
4. Save and restart the app

**Note:** The app will work fine without this - it uses cached results and basic features.

### **3. Your App URL**
Your app will be available at:
`https://YOUR_USERNAME-scholarship-hunter-uiapp-XXXXX.streamlit.app`

## 🚄 Railway Deployment (Backup)

### **1. Deploy to Railway**
1. Visit [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Choose "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select your repository
5. Railway will automatically detect and deploy

### **2. Environment Variables**
In Railway dashboard:
1. Go to Variables
2. Add: `GEMINI_API_KEY` = `your_api_key` (optional)

### **3. Custom Domain**
Railway will provide a URL like:
`https://scholarship-hunter-production-XXXX.up.railway.app`
